# CSCI-C 311 Homework

- This repository contains all of the homework and lab files associated with IUSB's CSCI-C 311 (Programming Languages) course of Spring 2018.  This is mostly just Elisp files, but there are a few other items in here as well.  

- Some homework problems required images.  They are stored in the [Images](https://github.com/JosephTLyons/CSCI-C-311-Elisp/tree/master/Images) folder with a figure number that is in the format of homework#.problem#.  Any homework that used an image also makes reference to this image within the file.

- Some homework problems required me to write initial versions in C++, which conveniently reside in the [C++ Solutions](https://github.com/JosephTLyons/CSCI-C-311-Elisp/tree/master/C%2B%2B%20Solutions) folder.

- The [Remove.sh](https://github.com/JosephTLyons/Lisp-Elisp/blob/master/Remove.sh) script simply removes backup and temporary files created by Emacs.

- For almost all of the problems, my solutions are correct.  However, there may still be a few errors present.  After I submitted an assignment, I usually did not change any of the code to correct it, unless it was a trivial action, such as formatting.

- **WARNING**: These solutions are only synced to my GitHub account for the sole purpose of personal backup!  This repository was private when working through the course, but if it ever becomes a public repository, **please do not use these solutions for your assignments**.
