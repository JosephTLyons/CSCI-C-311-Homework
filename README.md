# Lisp / Elisp

- This repository contains all Elisp homework and lab files associated with IUSB's CSCI-C 311 (Programming Languages) course of Spring 2018.  

- Some homework problems required me to write an initial version in C++, which conveniently reside in the "C++ Solutions" folder.

- **WARNING**: These solutions are only synced to my GitHub account for the sole purpose of personal backup!  This repository is currently private, but if it ever becomes a public repository, **please do not use these solutions for your assignments**.
