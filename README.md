# Lisp / Elisp

- This repository contains all Elisp homework and lab files associated with IUSB's CSCI-C 311 (Programming Languages) course of Spring 2018.  

- Some homework problems required me to write initial versions in C++, which conveniently reside in the "C++ Solutions" folder.

- The "[Miscellaneous](https://github.com/JosephTLyons/Lisp-Elisp/tree/master/Miscellaneous)" folder contains some Elisp files I wrote to help me better understand the language.  They have no relation to the assignments.

- The "[Remove.sh](https://github.com/JosephTLyons/Lisp-Elisp/blob/master/Remove.sh)" script simply removes backup and temporary files created by Emacs.

- **WARNING**: These solutions are only synced to my GitHub account for the sole purpose of personal backup!  This repository was private when working through the course, but if it ever becomes a public repository, **please do not use these solutions for your assignments**.
